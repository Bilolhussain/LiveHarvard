# LiveHarvard
Here's a deployed version of one of the features I want to add to LiveHarvard Website:

It's a webscrapper made using node.js and express with basic html, and css. It displays updated news taken from The Harvard Crimson's original website. I wanted to improve upon the way The Crimson displays the headlines of important events around campus without having to read through entire articles, which you may also do if you want to. But I personally find it more fun to read off the articles title and summary through my own website which uses Bootstrap. It's basic but I like the way it looks!
