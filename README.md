# LiveHarvard
Here's a deployed version of one of the features I want to add to LiveHarvard Website:
https://infinite-earth-99132.herokuapp.com is a webscrapper made using node.js and express with basic html, and css. It displays updated news taken from The Harvard Crimson's original website. I wanted to improve upon the way The Crimson displays the headlines of important events around campus without having to read through entire articles.
