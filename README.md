# LiveHarvard
Here's a deployed version of one of the features I want to add to LiveHarvard Website:

It's a webscrapper displaying updated news taken from The Harvard Crimson's original website. I wanted to improve upon the way The Crimson displays the headlines and important things to be aware of even without having to read through individual articles, which you may also do if you want to.
